    \title Using \QBF

    \section1 Organizing Designs

    To get the best results during export and import, follow these guidelines
    when working with Figma:

    \list
        \li Use pages for different purposes, such as \e sketching for trying
            out ideas, \e components for creating UI components, \e assets for
            images that you use in the components, and \e screens for building
            the UI screens using components and assets.
        \li Arrange each page into frames. When you are happy with a design,
            move it from the sketching page to the components page and use it
            in screens. When you export your assets, you can skip all frames
            that you don't want to be part of the final UI, to avoid cluttering
            the \QDS project. The code generated in \QDS corresponds to the
            structure of your Figma document.
        \li \QBF supports \e {Figma components}. Each Figma component
            is exported as a \e {\QDS component}, and each Figma component
            instance is generated as a respective component instance in the
            component files generated when you \l{Importing 2D Assets}{import}
            the design into \QDS.
        \li Create components in Figma and export them to \QDS before you
            start making instances of them. In \QDS, add functionality to the
            components, such as button states and then bring them back to Figma
            as assets. If you use functional \QDS components in Figma, you will
            find it easier to merge new iterations of the design to \QDS and
            continue to build the screens there.
        \li Use descriptive and unique IDs to avoid duplicate IDs after
            exporting designs and importing them to \QDS.
    \endlist

    To use the fonts that you use in Figma also in \QDS, you need to add
    them to \QDS as assets. \QDS deploys them to devices when you preview the
    UI. For more information, see \l{Using Custom Fonts}.

    \section2 Using Frames

    Frames are exported as components of the \l Rectangle type by default.
    However, if you have applied effects to the frames that \QBF cannot
    handle, such as gradient fill colors or a mixed radius, the frames are
    exported as images.

    \section1 Exporting Designs

    \image qt-figma-bridge.png "Qt Bridge for Figma"

    To export your design using \QBF:

    \list 1
        \li Specify settings for exporting each group and layer.
        \li Select \uicontrol Export to export your design.
        \li When the exporting is done, select \uicontrol OK.
    \endlist

    \QBF exports everything into a single archive. Before importing the design
    into \QDS, you have to manually extract the archive. Then you can import the
    \e .metainfo into a project in \QDS, as described in \l{Importing 2D Assets}.

    \section1 Export Settings

    You can specify export settings in the \uicontrol Home tab and in the
    \uicontrol Settings tab.

    \section2 Home

    You can specify settings for exporting each group and layer.

    \table
    \header
        \li Name
        \li Purpose
    \row
        \li \uicontrol ID
        \li \QBF automatically proposes identifiers for all groups and layers.
            You can change them in this field. Use unique and descriptive IDs
            to avoid duplicate IDs when the layer and the respective artwork
            are imported into \QDS.
    \row
        \li \uicontrol {Export as}
        \li Determines how to export the group or layer:
            \list
               \li \uicontrol Child exports each asset of the selected group
                    or layer as a separate PNG file, with references
                    to the images in the component file.
                \li \uicontrol Merged merges the selected groups and layers into
                    the parent frame or group as one component.
                \li \uicontrol Skipped completely skips the selected layer.
            \endlist
    \row
        \li \uicontrol {Custom Component Type}
        \li Determines the \l{Component Types}{component type} to morph this
            layer into. The component that is generated during import will be
            of this type. For example, if you drew a rectangle, you can export
            it as a \l Rectangle component. You can provide the
            \l{QML Imports}{import statement} of the component set where the
            component is defined in the \uicontrol {Imports} field.
    \row
        \li \uicontrol Properties
        \li Sets values of properties for the component. You can add properties
            and modify their values in \QDS.
    \row
        \li \uicontrol Imports
        \li If you want to make additional components available in the component
            file, you can enter the import statements of the component sets in
            this field. For example, to use components of the Controls type from
            version 2.3, you need the import statement \c {QtQuick.Controls 2.3}
            and to use Studio Components from version 1.0, you need the import
            statement \c {QtQuick.Studio.Components 1.0}. You can add components
            from all the available component sets in \QDS later. You can also
            import a component set as an \e alias.
    \row
        \li \uicontrol Alias
        \li Exports the component generated from this layer as an alias in the
            parent component.
    \row
        \li \uicontrol Visible
        \li Determines the visibility of the layer.
    \row
        \li \uicontrol Clip
        \li Enables clipping in the component generated from the layer. The
            generated component will clip its own painting, as well as the
            painting of its children, to its bounding rectangle.
    \endtable

    \section2 Settings

    \image qt-figma-bridge-settings.png

    You can export assets in the selected format (JPG, PNG, or SVG).

    In addition, you can export shapes as components of the type SvgPathItem.
    This might not work for layers that have particular effects applied to them.
    In that case, the layers are exported as images.

    \table
    \header
        \li Name
        \li Purpose
    \row
        \li \uicontrol {Asset settings}
        \li Exports assets in the selected format (JPG, PNG, or SVG).
    \row
        \li \uicontrol {Export as shapes}
        \li Exports shapes as components of the type SvgPathItem.

            Because MCUs only support simple images, disable this
            check box when designing for MCUs.
    \row
        \li \uicontrol {Reset plugin data}
        \li Resets all settings for all layers and groups (also in the
            \uicontrol Home tab) to default values. This means that you
            will lose all your changes to the settings.
    \endtable
